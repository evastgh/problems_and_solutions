\section*{General Informations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Textbook:} O. Bretscher, Linear Algebra, 5th Ed., Prentice Hall.
  \item {\bf Course Outline:} Detailed course description and tentative lecture schedule at \\ \href{https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/math/33A}{https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/math/33A}. This course covers Chapter 1-3 and 5-8 of the textbook.
  \item {\bf Midterm exams:} Two in-class midterm exams (50 minutes) on April 22nd the Monday and May 13th the Monday.
  \item {\bf Final exam:} Cumulative/comprehensive final exam (180 minutes) on June 13th the Thursday.
  \item {\bf Homework/Quizzes:} Weekly homework assigned each Monday on \href{https://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/19S-MATH33A-4}{CCLE} and due on Friday. Last 10 minutes of Friday lecture are dedicated to in-class quizzes. Submit homework and quiz together; homework is graded based on completion. 
  \
\end{itemize}

\section*{Grading Policy}
Two lowest homework/quiz grades are dropped to accommodate medical reasons and technical difficulties, etc. Course grades are given based on the higher of the following two schemes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 15\% Homework/Quizzes + 20\% Midterm 1 + 20\% Midterm 2 + 45\% Final
  \item 10\% Homework/Quizzes + 35\% (Best of two Midterms) + 55\% Final
\end{itemize}
Shall any curving take place, your curved grade will remain larger than or equal to your original one.
